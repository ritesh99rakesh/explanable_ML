# explanable_ML
We built a **web application** through which people can explain the predictions of various classifiers on different datasets
using *LIME* as well as *aLIME*
They needn’t have any expertise in programming or machine learning.
We’ve made the entire cumbersome process end to end.
The user just needs to upload the dataset in a rectangular format consisting of only of numerical entries with no entries missing.
Then he needs to type in various *features* and *class labels* that the dataset comprises of.

After that he can select various parameters like the explainer, classifier, number of top features, etc. 

Some sample screenshots of the process are shown in the figure below.
